                <p>I’m a hard-working person who is constantly looking to acquire knowledge and improve my skills to become a high-value professional in the Software Engineering and Development industries.</p>
                <p>I’m currently seeking to become part of a project or company to contribute and strengthen my knowledge and skills to continue constructing my professional profile with work experience.  </p>
                <p>Especially in any area related with Linux, backend and desktop/business software development since I’m very interested in learning more on these topics and working with them because they are developed with programming languages and technologies that I understand quite well and work with comfortably. I’m also very interested in learning new technologies and programming languages that improve my skill set and professional profile to extend even more my knowledge on the software development industry.</p>
